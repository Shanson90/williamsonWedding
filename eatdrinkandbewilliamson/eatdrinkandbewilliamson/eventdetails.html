	<p class="text">
		Bring your skis, an empty stomach, and perhaps some Alka-Seltzer for a fun-filled weekend of skiing, eating, and much merry making (euphemism for drinking). We're planning to get married in the beautiful rockies next winter.  We'll be reserving a block of hotel rooms for those flying in, and hope everyone can at least stay for a long weekend.  The main event will be Saturday afternoon and evening, but we won't be leaving for the honeymoon until the following Wednesday as we want to stay to ski and celebrate with all of you we love so much.
